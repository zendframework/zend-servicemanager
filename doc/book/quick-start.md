# Quick Start

The Service Manager is a modern, fast, and easy-to-use implementation of the
[Service Locator design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern).
The implementation implements the
[Container Interop](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop)
interfaces, providing interoperability with other implementations.

The following is a "quick start" tutorial intended to get you up and running
with the most common features of the Service manager.

## 1. Install Zend Service Manager

If you haven't already, [install Composer](https://getcomposer.org). Once you
have, you can install the service manager:

```bash
$ composer require zendframework/zend-servicemanager
```

## 2. Configuring a service manager

You can now create and configure a service manager. The service manager
constructor accepts a simple array:

```php
use Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManager;
use Zend\ServiceManager\Factory\InvokableFactory;
use stdClass;

$serviceManager = new ServiceManager([
    'factories' => [
        stdClass::class => InvokableFactory::class,
    ],
]);
```

The service manager accepts a variety of keys; refer to the
[Configuring service manager](configuring-the-service-manager.md) section for
full details.

## 3. Retrieving objects

Finally, you can retrieve instances using the `get()` method:

```php
$object = $serviceManager->get(stdClass::class);
```

By default, all objects created through the service manager are shared. This
means that calling the `get()` method twice will return the exact same object:

```php
$object1 = $serviceManager->get(stdClass::class);
$object2 = $serviceManager->get(stdClass::class);

var_dump($object1 === $object2); // prints "true"
```

You can use the `build()` method to retrieve discrete instances for a service:

```php
$object1 = $serviceManager->build(stdClass::class);
$object2 = $serviceManager->build(stdClass::class);

var_dump($object1 === $object2); // prints "true"
```
